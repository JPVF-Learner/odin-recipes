        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Believe it or not, you can make your own delicious, low-fat microwave popcorn using standard popping corn and a brown paper lunch bag. It works perfectly.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup unpopped popcorn</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix together unpopped popcorn and oil in a cup or small bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour the coated corn into a brown paper lunch sack, and sprinkle in the salt. Fold the top of the bag over twice to seal in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook in the microwave at full power for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, or until you hear pauses of about 2 seconds between pops. Carefully open the bag to avoid steam, and pour into a serving bowl.</li>
