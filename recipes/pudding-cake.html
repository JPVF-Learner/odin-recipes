            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>

            <li>2 (3.9 ounce) packages instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer at low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 21 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Poke holes immediately into warm cake with the round handle of a wooden spoon. Holes should be at 1 inch intervals and extend down to the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Combine pudding mix with confectioners' sugar in a separate large bowl and gradually stir in milk. Beat with an electric mixer at low speed for 1 minute; do not overbeat.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the pudding mixture immediately over warm cake and into holes.</li>
            <li>Let remaining pudding thicken slightly at room temperature, then spoon over the top and spread to cover. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
