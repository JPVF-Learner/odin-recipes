# Odin Recipes

An HTML only recipes site.  

This is an exercise/project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) _Foundations_ course.  

What HTML concepts I'll practice here:

- Create the basic structure for HTML files.
- Handle text and headings.
- Handle links and images.

In addition, I'll practice things like:

- Manage files from command line interface.
- Create and update repositories with git and GitHub.
